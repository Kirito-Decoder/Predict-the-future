# A hybrid deep learning-based method for short-term building energy load prediction combined with an interpretation process
Data driven-based building energy load prediction is of great value for building energy management
tasks such as fault diagnosis and optimal control. However, there are two challenges for conventional
data driven-based prediction methods. The first challenge is that time-lag measurements such as historical
cooling loads still cannot be taken full advantage of. To deal with this challenge, a hybrid prediction
method is proposed based on long short-term memory networks and artificial neural networks. The second
challenge is that data driven-based models are hard to explain by domain knowledge. To deal with
this challenge, an interpretation method is proposed based on a dimensionless sensitivity index and a
weighted Manhattan distance. Operation data of a public building are utilized to evaluate the proposed
methods. Results show that the proposed hybrid prediction method has higher prediction accuracy than
conventional prediction methods in one-hour-ahead cooling load prediction. Crucial factors affecting
building cooling loads are revealed successfully based on the proposed sensitivity index. Moreover, the
weighted Manhattan distance is utilized to quantify the difference between predicted conditions and
known conditions of training data. Results show that the prediction accuracy of data driven-based methods
is reduced with the increase of the weighted Manhattan distance. It is further discovered that relationships
between logarithmic prediction residuals and corresponding logarithmic weighted Manhattan
distances are approximatively linear.
